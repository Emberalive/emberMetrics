# EmberMetrics

EmberMetrics is a lightweight Node.js script (and soon a full app) to monitor and display your deviceâ€™s system metrics, including CPU usage, memory usage, and device information.

---

## Features

- Displays device information such as platform, OS name, release, version, architecture, and hostname.
- Continuously monitors CPU usage per core and calculates total CPU load.
- Shows memory usage as available and used percentages.
- Updates metrics every second.

---

## Installation

Make sure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed.

Clone the repository or copy the script.
